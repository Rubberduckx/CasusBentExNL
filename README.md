# Exotisch Nederland - Pilot Midden-Limburg

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development of a mobile application for Exotisch Nederland, focusing on the **Pilot Midden-Limburg** project. The goal of this project is to enhance the experience of nature monitoring and observation, and to promote engagement with the environment by making the collection and management of wildlife and plant data more efficient.

## Casus - Exotisch Nederland

### Missie en Visie

Exotisch Nederland aims to **protect, enhance, and sustainably manage** the green heritage of the country. We work towards a future where nature is both preserved and experienced in harmony with sustainable practices. Our motto is *“Dat zit in onze natuur”* (It's in our nature). By 2025, our mission is aligned with three core pillars:
1. **Better protection** of nature.
2. **More engagement** with the public.
3. **Sustainable utilization** of our resources.

### Geschiedenis

Founded in 1899 and restructured in 1998, Exotisch Nederland operates as an independent administrative body (RWT) under the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, with a focus on managing natural terrains and integrating sustainable development into society.

## Opdracht

We are focusing on improving our engagement strategy under the **"More Engagement"** pillar. Currently, volunteers are key to gathering data about native and exotic species, but the manual process is slow and inefficient. We aim to digitize this process with a **mobile app** that allows volunteers and the general public to submit wildlife and plant observations directly from the field.

### Opdrachtomschrijving

The pilot will take place in the **Midden-Limburg** area. The mobile app must:
1. Allow users to submit observations with:
   - **Name** of the animal/plant (required)
   - **Category** (required) – e.g., tree species, animal type
   - **Location** (automatically filled in if possible)
   - **Description** (optional)
   - **Photo** (optional)
2. Include a **navigation** feature for volunteers to locate specific areas.
3. Provide a platform for the public, including children, to engage through a **serious game** that involves nature quests and informative games.
4. Enable planning of routes through natural areas with an option to visit the nearest restaurant at lunchtime.

### Op te leveren

1. **Application Code**: The application will be built using the graph-library discussed in week 4. It will provide navigation and allow users to plan routes between natural areas and nearby facilities.
2. **Day Program Generator**: The app will generate a day plan based on selected locations, incorporating nearby restaurants for lunch.
3. **Test Report**: A report showcasing the functionality and performance of the app.
4. **Research Report**: Justification of the chosen data structures and algorithms, with special attention to recursive algorithms and complexity analysis, including average-case and worst-case scenarios.

## Development Guidelines

### Branch Structure

We follow a branching structure that ensures code stability and organized development:

- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code.
- **Staging Branch**: Pre-production, used for testing.
- **Working Branch**: Feature or task-specific branches, named after the Linear ticket (e.g., `BEN-1`).

### Pull Requests (PRs)

All pull requests must meet the following criteria:
1. **At least one reviewer** is required to review and approve the PR before merging into the main branch.
2. Ensure that PRs are well-documented and follow our [commenting standards](https://conventionalcomments.org/).

### Commit Messages

We adhere to **conventional commit** guidelines for all commit messages. This ensures clarity and traceability throughout the development process. Please refer to this guide for detailed examples:
